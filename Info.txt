Pressing Q toggles the automatic camera track, cycling around the scene and then doing a topdown view

Pressing T toggles the track of the light causing shadows on the scene. 
This light loops over and under the scene like a daylight cycle. T will pause this

Pressing B will toggle the full scene gaussian blur. This has 10 passes.
